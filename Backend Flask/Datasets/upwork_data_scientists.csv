United States,"*** Please note, I get a fair number of invitations to interview for jobs where the budget is very low, $50 or $25 and so on. While I would like to help, I just don't have the time for smaller or low-budget projects. I am looking for larger, multi-hour projects that are paid on an hourly basis (not flat fee) and have a minimum budget of $500. Thanks for understanding. ***I have over 30 years of experience in research, evaluation, statistics, and project management. I have advanced evaluation and statistical analytic skills and am fluent in Stata and SPSS and have been developing my analytic skills using R to where I am now comfortable working in this language as well.. I also use Mplus for latent variable modeling. I have designed and analyzed online surveys using Survey Monkey, Qualtrix, and REDCap.I have a PhD in clinical psychology and am a tenured Full Professor. I teach beginning and intermediate statistics to doctoral and master's level students. I also teach program evaluation and mental health policy, including substance abuse policy. For samples of my writing style, you are welcome to use the ""Look Inside"" feature on Amazon to review sections of my book: Substance abuse in America: A documentary and reference guide. I am also happy to provide samples of papers published in peer-reviewed journals.My writing and oral skills are excellent and I am comfortable both developing as well as conducting trainings, workshops, and presentations. I can also help with editing and writing technical or non-technical documents but I am highly selective about this kind of work. I will be happy to review sections in dissertations and theses, but I will not write these or other student papers because I believe this violates academic integrity. I also will not accept homework assignments for the same reason.Things I can help you do:1) Translate data in Excel or ASCII format into a data set for analysis in just about any commonly used statistical program.2) Run basic screening and descriptive statistics such as frequencies, measures of central tendency and dispersion, and distributional statistics to assess skew and kurtosis.3) Run bivariate analyses such as t-tests, correlations, and chi-square tests as well as non-parametric procedures like Kruskal-Wallis.4) Check missing values and conduct imputation-based analyses for missing data as needed.5) Run more advanced analytical models including: factorial ANOVA, regression (OLS, binary, ordinal, and multinomial logistic as well as Poisson and negative binomial), GEE for repeated measures data, HLM, factor analysis, latent class analysis, SEM, and growth mixture models.6) Review and advise on statistical analyses already run including interpretation of the findings.7) Review, advise, and edit write-ups of statistical results and methods sections.8) Prospective advice on study design, including sampling, measures, and data collection protocols.9) Write and edit proposals. I am available to be a project evaluator and would be happy to help you write the evaluation section of your proposal as well as conduct the evaluation if funded. Or, if you just need a review and editing of your proposal, I can do that as well.10) Develop surveys and survey questions. I have extensive experience developing surveys including online surveys using tools such as Survey Monkey, REDCap, and Qualtrics.If you are unsure whether I can help with your project, please do not hesitate to send me a message.

But don't just take my word for it. Here's a client's feedback:""""Parth is amazing to work with! He has gone above and beyond to make sure that the project was done timely and accurately. He was able to manage 2 social media pages for us on 2 separate platforms. He helped with content creation and posting. He engaged our followers and made sure that our page was constantly growing. He is a valuable part of our team! Should we have any more social media projects he will be the first person we reach out to! We have very happy with the work he has contributed to our organization.""!""",20.0,100%,Dehradun,Parthsarthi D.,Graphic Design|YouTube Marketing|Social Media Marketing Strategy|Data Science|Digital Marketing|Social Media Content Creation|Social Media Strategy|Social Media Marketing|Social Media Advertising|Content Creation|Social Media Management|Community Management|Instagram Marketing|Twitter/X Marketing|Front-End Development,Expert Social Media Manager | Youtube | Instagram | Twitter | FB,253.0,160
